Please note that this component contains symlinks to source outside of the esphome directory stucture.
This should be fine for the Esphome environment itself, but on Windows machines this may not play nicely...

If you run into issues related to source files not being found, clone the repository in an elevated (with administrator rights) command prompt using the following command:
`git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/RoboMagus/ESP32-MQTT-Bluetooth-Monitor.git`
